# Chatspace AI
This project aims to separate Chatspace from web server as independent API.

Chatspace is Korean Sentence spacing module according to grammar. Being developed by chatbot company [Pingpong](https://github.com/pingpong-ai/chatspace), it shows good performance for proofreading. 

But Chatspace uses torch as dependency. On linux, torch module takes up 750MB of disk space in linux environment. Thus itâ€™s too heavy to run with other applications on the same server.
